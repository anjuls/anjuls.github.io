      <description>Welcome to the new year 2020. I want to take a pause to reflect on the last year on personal and professional front. The year was nearly flat and steady. There were no surprises, spikes like last year especially on the personal side. Personally, I have enjoyed the whole year with the family and friends in Melbourne. 2019 was also a year of change. I changed many projects this year unlike one in past one decade.</description>
