      <description>Welcome to the new year 2020. I want to take a pause to reflect on the last year on personal and professional front. The year was nearly flat and steady. There were no surprises, spikes like last year especially on the personal side. Personally, I have enjoyed the whole year with the family and friends in Melbourne. 2019 was also a year of change. I changed many projects this year unlike one in past one decade.</description>

      <description>Hi World! I have setup this blog after various stints which covered personal and Oracle database stuff but for a long time, I have been away from the blogging. The reason is primarily getting busy with family life and switching roles. Last week, I came across my twitter timeline bidding .dev domains and I got excited to reserve my own anjul.dev last night. I intent to call this my permanent home on the Internet.</description>
