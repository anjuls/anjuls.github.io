		<p>Hi World! I have setup this blog after various stints which covered personal and Oracle database stuff but for a long time, I have been away from the blogging.  The reason is primarily getting busy with family life and switching roles. Last week, I came across my twitter timeline bidding <code>.dev</code> domains and I got excited to reserve my own <code>anjul.dev</code> last night. I intent to call this my permanent home on the Internet. I would cover topics on containers, Kubernetes, Linux, and generally anything which excites me.</p>
<p>Please feel free to connect and follow this blog. I will make sure, I don&rsquo;t post boring, spammy posts.</p>
